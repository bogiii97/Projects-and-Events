.SH NAME 
\fBminesweeper.sh\fP - the classic game in text mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBminesweeper.sh\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The conceptually good games are not tied to the graphic environment or fancy
input devices. And they absolutely not need cheap visual effects. In text mode
you can enjoy the real flavour of the game.
.SH OPTIONS
none
.SH RULES
The board is composed by square of stones and a number of randomly placed mines,
under the stones. The goal is to mark all the mined stones with flags. When you
step on a stone, if under that one is a mine, you die and the game is over. Else
the stone is removed. If there is no mine neighter under the nearest stones,
then they will be also removed, until a mine is aproached. In the place of the
removed stones a number will appear which show how many of the nearest stones
are mined.
